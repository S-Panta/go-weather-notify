## The idea was initally to just create a weather reminder that works as gadget in Ubuntu GNOME extension

Later I found out that it was built on JavaScript and Go server should be made and JS should act as client.
That's not bad but I have changed the idea.

- Create a bot that listens to rocketchat. (Is it possible to create rocketchat bot?). Remember your pc should be the server not the jankaritech as server, otherwise that would be weird. let's not break anything. 
- Create a server and make sure go works.
- Weather reminder.
- Daily quote generator using SEP.
